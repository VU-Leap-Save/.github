Welcome to the Vanderbilt Leap-Save github!

## Rules for contributors
1. Your main/master branch should contain tested and working code. Keep experimental/in-development code in branches.
2. Use pull requests and request code reviews from team members before merging code into main/master.
3. Every repository should have a README or wiki that contains: 
   1. List of dependencies and target platforms
   2. Installation instructions
   3. A quickstart guide (i.e. instructions for running the code)
4. Every repository should have a `.gitignore` file.
5. Recommended: Create a style guide and code standards document for your repo/team. For example, see the [`robot_controller` wiki](https://github.com/VU-Leap-Save/robot_controller/wiki/Conventions-and-Style-Guide)
